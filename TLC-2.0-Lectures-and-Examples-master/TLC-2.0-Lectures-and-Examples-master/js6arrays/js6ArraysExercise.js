// JavaScript 6 Exercise: Arrays

// 1) Use the length property on each of the following lists:

// a) let george = ["English", 26, 87, "comedian", "pasta", new Date('December 22 1992 12:24:17'), new Date('January 31 2079 07:05:19')];

// b) ["α","β","ψ","δ","ε","φ","γ","η","ι","ξ","κ","λ","μ","ν","ο","π",";","ρ","σ","τ","θ","ω","ς","χ","υ","ζ"];

// c) ['16-bit', 'shooter', 1993, 'Data East', 'Bren McGuire', 'The Machine', 'IGN rating: ', 7.5]

// d) let fragileMageData = [['health', [76, 120], 1, 1, 0, 1, 'Health Bar'], ['magic', [7263, 9001], 0, 1, 1, 0, 'Mana'], ['energy', [0, 0], 1, 0, 1, 0, 'Not a melee!']];

// 2) Obtain the following values using indexing of the above lists:

// a) The birth date of George

// b) The death date of George

// c) The 14th letter of the Greek alphabet

// d) The letter rho (ρ)

// e) The genre of the game described in 1(c)

// f) The 'Mana' element of fragileMageData

// g) Fragile mage's maximum mana (listed in the sublist right after the 'magic' element)

// h) Fragile mage's minimum and maximum energy (the whole sublist)

// 3) Give an example of each of the following methods on any list that you like that is at least 5 elements long (the above lists are also okay):

// a) indexOf

// b) Array.isArray

// c) push

// d) pop

// e) shift

// f) unshift

// g) slice

// h) splice

// i) reverse

// j) concat

// k) sort

// 4) HexGL is a "futuristic, fast-paced racing game built on HTML5, JavaScript and WebGL." Since it is entirely browser-based, we can look inside the JavaScript files go gain more information about its construction.

// a) Start playing HexGL. Once you die (or decide to pause), open up Developer Tools.

// b) Look for the HTML element corresponding to the "launch.js" file on the Elements tab. Where is it (and most of the other scripts) located in the file?

// c) Look for the long list named 's' that contains information on 'controlType', 'quality', and other properties of the game. Paste it here:

// d) What control types are allowed in this game? Use indexing to obtain the list of control types:

// e) What platforms are available? Use indexing to obtain the second platform only:

// f) Use indexing to replace the 'MID' value with 'MEDIUM':

// g) Use splicing to obtain (and remove) the Godmode information (no cheating!):

// 5) Open the following game file: /bkcore/threejs/Loader.js and answer the following:

// a) Look for the 'urls' list and paste it here:

// b) What is the length of this list? Answer by counting.

// c) Now answer by using the length property.

// c) What is this list doing? HINT: google 'threejs loadTextureCube' and read some documentation.

// d) Explain why there are six elements in this list as opposed to any other number.
