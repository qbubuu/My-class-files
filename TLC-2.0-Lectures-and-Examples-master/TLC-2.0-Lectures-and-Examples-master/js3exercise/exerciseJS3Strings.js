/* JavaScript 3 Exercise - Strings, String Methods, & Project Setup

DIRECTIONS: Use only Visual Studio Code file editing, the console, and string methods & properties to solve these problems. NO LOOPS! >:D

---

1) Make a template string with 5 variables inside of it and at least 3 escape characters.

2) Give an example of each property and method in the lecture (the sections given in CAPS). The work for this problem should be split across group members.

3) Write the results of the following operations, and how you found them (brief explanation is okay):

  a) The character at index 12 of "I have this string..."

  b) The character at index 27 of "Changing case (capitalization and uncapitalization)"

  c) The 1000th character of the Gettysburg Address.

  d) The 401st through 457th characters of the Gettysburg Address.

  e) The 200th word of the Gettysburg Address.

  f) The index of the first occurrence of the word 'a' in the Gettysburg Address.

  g) The index of the last occurrence of the word 'a' in the Gettysburg Address. 

  h) The character length of the original app.js file for this lecture. Hard and you should work with the whole team, if necessary.

4) Here's how to replace a substring in JavaScript:

  longString.replace(oldSubstring, newSubstring);

  For example:

  "Cincinnati".replace('cin', 'sen');

  yields:

  "Cinsennati"

  since 'C' != 'c' (C is not equal to c) from the point of view of JS. 

  Even still, this unfortunately only replaces the first 'cin' that occurs:

  "cincinnati".replace('cin', 'cent'); // "centcinnati"

Using the Internet, find an easy way to replace ALL occurrences of a substring with another substring. The method, not including the longString, oldSubstring, and newSubstring, should be less than 20 characters long.

5) Replicate the effect of the long s (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_s) in the Gettysburg Address. That is, replace each single s with an f, and each first s in a double s with an f.
